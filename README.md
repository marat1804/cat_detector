This is my cat detector based on Haar cascades. There is also comparison between the cascade trained by me and the one provided by OpenCV

In this software I used Haad cascade and Viola-Jones algorithm

* Blue - OpenCV cat cascade
* Green - OpenCV cat extended cascade
* Red - my own trained cascade
* Cyan - my cascade with less amount of Haar features
